# pharo-acp-client

This is an ACP (client-side) library for Pharo Smalltalk.

It references the ACP implementation in TypeScript (https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/typescript-sdk).

It enables communication from the Smalltalk side, via ACP, with coding agents that support ACP, such as Gemini CLI and Open Code.
